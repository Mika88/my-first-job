# MY FIRST JOB

This is a single page application writen in JavaScript with a Ruby on Rails backend. My-First-Job is meant for local youth to find jobs by posting job posts offering different services such as babysitting, and dog walking; and for homeowners to find help through posting wanted posts offering similar jobs to the local youth. 

## Usage

To use this application, clone the repository, run 'bundle install' to install all the gems, run rake db:migrate and then run rails s. 
Entering localhost:3000 in your browser will redirect you to the home page. 
Once there you can use the links in the navbar to create a new post, view posts submitted by others, or go to the home page.
